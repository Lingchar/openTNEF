21 September 2008:
	Changed file_num in handle_props from a static var
	to a global struct var in order to prevent cumulative
	incrementation between multiple calls of the function
	within the same process causing different output 
	filenames despite the same input being supplied.


10 Apr 2003:
	PLD: Original Source code release from ripMIME project
		as openTNEF.
